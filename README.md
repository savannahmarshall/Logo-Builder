# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description
This command-line application functions takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

While completing this application, I learned how to:

* Revisit creating interactive command-line prompts for a Node.js application.
* Utilize classes to create different shape and color options for the logo.
* Use a switch statement.
* Create different tests using Jest framework.

Some challenges I faced were:

* Creating the tests was difficult for me to figure out because there are so many parts that need to be included.
* I had a bug in my code where I was trying to import inquirer.
* The switch/case was confusing at first and I had to research a few examples on how to set it up.]
* I had trouble figuring out how to center the text for the square and circle logo options.
