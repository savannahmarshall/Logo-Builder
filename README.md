# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description
This command-line application generates a logo based on user input and saves it as an SVG file. Users can select a shape and color, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

### Key Learnings:
* Interactive Command-Line Prompts: Refined skills in creating interactive command-line prompts using Node.js.
* Class Utilization: Leveraged classes to define various shape and color options for the logo.
* Switch Statements: Implemented switch statements for conditional logic based on user choices.
* Jest Framework: Developed and ran tests using the Jest framework to ensure code reliability.

### Challenges Faced:
* Testing Complexity: Understanding the numerous components needed for comprehensive tests was challenging.
* Inquirer Import Issue: Encountered and resolved a bug related to importing the Inquirer package.
* Switch/Case Implementation: Initially found switch/case statements confusing but overcame this by researching examples.
* Text Centering: Faced difficulties in centering text within the square and circle shapes, which required additional research and adjustments.
